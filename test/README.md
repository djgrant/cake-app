The scope of this test was far too large for the time allocated. Consequently I tackled the requirements in the order that they were specified, and as writing tests was the last requirement, I gave it the lowest priority (much to my discomfort).

Seeing as you're here - and I don't want to leave you feeling disappointed - you might like to take a look at tests I've written in one of my open source projects:

* https://github.com/djgrant/react-quest/tree/master/specs
